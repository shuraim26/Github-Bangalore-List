This Project lists all the Github users based out of Bangalore and allows to search from all Github users residing in Bangalore.

Do note that the Github API rate limit allows for only 30 calls per minute, and there should be 2 second delay between each request. Hence, don't spam the next or previous pagination button.

If you face no results being shown up, check console. If you get "status 403", it is caused by the Github API rate limit. The solution is to try again after a few minutes.

This project did not require any sort of Backend.

To start the server, run "npm start" in the root directory.
